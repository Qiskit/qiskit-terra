    Fixed a bug in :class:`.CommutativeCancellation` which did not consider cancellation of
    some diagonal gates or the :class:`.SXGate`. Now these are correctly included and e.g. 
    the following circuit::

                ┌─────┐
      q_0: ──■──┤ Sdg ├──■──
           ┌─┴─┐└┬────┤┌─┴─┐
      q_1: ┤ X ├─┤ √X ├┤ X ├
           └───┘ └────┘└───┘

    is correctly reduced to::

           ┌─────┐
      q_0: ┤ Sdg ├
           └┬────┤
      q_1: ─┤ √X ├
            └────┘
