    """A class to swap route one or more commuting gates to the coupling map.

    This pass routes blocks of commuting two-qubit gates encapsulated as
    :class:`.Commuting2qBlock` instructions. This pass will not apply to other instructions.
    The mapping to the coupling map is done using swap strategies, see :class:`.SwapStrategy`.
    The swap strategy should suit the problem and the coupling map. This transpiler pass
    should ideally be executed before the quantum circuit is enlarged with any idle ancilla
    qubits. Otherwise, we may swap qubits outside the portion of the chip we want to use.
    Therefore, the swap strategy and its associated coupling map do not represent physical
    qubits. Instead, they represent an intermediate mapping that corresponds to the physical
    qubits once the initial layout is applied. The example below shows how to map a four
    qubit :class:`.PauliEvolutionGate` to qubits 0, 1, 3, and 4 of the five qubit device with
    the coupling map

    .. code-block:: text

        0 -- 1 -- 2
             |
             3
             |
             4

    To do this we use a line swap strategy for qubits 0, 1, 3, and 4 defined it in terms
    of virtual qubits 0, 1, 2, and 3.

    This pass manager relies on the ``current_layout`` which corresponds to the qubit layout as
    swap gates are applied. The pass will traverse all nodes in the dag. If a node should be
    routed using a swap strategy then it will be decomposed into sub-instructions with swap
    layers in between and the ``current_layout`` will be modified. Nodes that should not be
    routed using swap strategies will be added back to the dag taking the ``current_layout``
    into account.
