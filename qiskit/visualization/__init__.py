Visualizations (:mod:`qiskit.visualization`)
============================================

.. currentmodule:: qiskit.visualization

The visualization module contain functions that visualizes measurement outcome counts, quantum
states, circuits, pulses, devices and more.

To use visualization functions, you are required to install visualization optionals to your
development environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install 'qiskit[visualization]'

Common Keyword Arguments
========================

Many of the figures created by visualization functions in this module are created by `Matplotlib
<https://matplotlib.org/>`_ and accept a subset of the following common arguments. Consult the
individual documentation for exact details.

* ``title`` (``str``): a text string to use for the plot title.
* ``legend`` (``list``): a list of strings to use for labels of the data.
* ``figsize`` (``tuple``): figure size in inches .
* ``color`` (``list``): a list of strings for plotting.
* ``ax`` (`matplotlib.axes.Axes <https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/axes_api.html>`_): An optional
  ``Axes`` object to be used for the visualization output. If none is specified a new
  `matplotlib.figure.Figure <https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/figure_api.html>`_ will be created
  and used. Additionally, if specified there will be no returned ``Figure`` since it is redundant.
* ``filename`` (``str``): file path to save image to.

The following example demonstrates the common usage of these arguments:

.. plot::
   :alt: Output from the previous code.
   :include-source:

   from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

   counts1 = {'00': 499, '11': 501}
   counts2 = {'00': 511, '11': 489}

   data = [counts1, counts2]
   plot_histogram(data)

You can specify ``legend``, ``title``, ``figsize`` and ``color`` by passing to the kwargs.

.. plot::
   :alt: Output from the previous code.
   :include-source:
   :context: reset

   from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

   counts1 = {'00': 499, '11': 501}
   counts2 = {'00': 511, '11': 489}
   data = [counts1, counts2]

   legend = ['First execution', 'Second execution']
   title = 'New histogram'
   figsize = (10,10)
   color=['crimson','midnightblue']
   plot_histogram(data, legend=legend, title=title, figsize=figsize, color=color)

You can save the figure to file either by passing the file name to ``filename`` kwarg or use
`matplotlib.figure.Figure.savefig
<https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/figure_api.html#matplotlib.figure.Figure.savefig>`_ method.

.. code-block:: python

   plot_histogram(data, filename='new_hist.png')

   hist = plot_histogram(data)
   hist.savefig('new_hist.png')


Counts Visualizations
=====================

This section contains functions that visualize measurement outcome counts.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../stubs/

   plot_histogram

Example Usage
-------------

Here is an example of using :func:`plot_histogram` to visualize measurement outcome counts:

.. plot::
   :alt: Output from the previous code.
   :include-source:

   from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

   counts = {"00": 501, "11": 499}
   plot_histogram(counts)

The data can be a dictionary with bit string as key and counts as value, or more commonly a
:class:`~qiskit.result.Counts` object obtained from :meth:`~qiskit.result.Result.get_counts`.

Distribution Visualizations
===========================

This section contains functions that visualize sampled distributions.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../stubs/

   plot_distribution

State Visualizations
====================

This section contains functions that visualize quantum states.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../stubs/

   plot_bloch_vector
   plot_bloch_multivector
   plot_state_city
   plot_state_hinton
   plot_state_paulivec
   plot_state_qsphere

Example Usage
-------------

Here is an example of using :func:`plot_state_city` to visualize a quantum state:

.. plot::
   :alt: Output from the previous code.
   :include-source:

   from qiskit.visualization import plot_state_city

   state = [[ 0.75  , 0.433j],
            [-0.433j, 0.25  ]]
   plot_state_city(state)

The state can be array-like list of lists, ``numpy.array``, or more commonly
:class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Statevector` or :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.DensityMatrix` objects
obtained from a :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit`:

.. plot::
   :alt: Output from the previous code.
   :include-source:

   from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
   from qiskit.quantum_info import Statevector
   from qiskit.visualization import plot_state_city

   qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
   qc.h(0)
   qc.cx(0,1)

   # plot using a Statevector
   state = Statevector(qc)
   plot_state_city(state)

.. plot::
   :alt: Output from the previous code.
   :include-source:

   from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
   from qiskit.quantum_info import DensityMatrix
   from qiskit.visualization import plot_state_city

   qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
   qc.h(0)
   qc.cx(0,1)

   # plot using a DensityMatrix
   state = DensityMatrix(qc)
   plot_state_city(state)

You can find code examples for each visualization functions on the individual function API page.
