    """Generate random circuit of arbitrary size and form which strictly respect the interaction
    graph passed as argument. Interaction Graph is a graph G=(V, E) where V are the qubits in the
    circuit, and, E is the set of two-qubit gate interactions between two particular qubits in the
    circuit.

    This function will generate a random circuit by randomly selecting gates from the set of
    standard gates in :mod:`qiskit.circuit.library.standard_gates`. User can attach a numerical
    value as a metadata to the edge of the graph indicating the edge weight for that particular edge,
    These edge weights would be normalized to the probabilities for the edges of getting selected.
    If all the edge weights are passed as `None`, then the probability of each qubit-pair of getting
    selected is set to 1/N, where `N` is the number of edges in the interaction_graph passed in,
    i.e each edge is drawn uniformly. If any weight of an edge is set as zero, that particular
    edge will be not be included in the output circuit.

    If numerical values are present as probabilities but some/any are None, or negative, this will
    raise a ValueError.

    If :arg:`max_operands` is set to 1, then there are no 2Q operations, so no need to take care
    of the edges, in such case the function will return a circuit from the `random_circuit` function,
    which would be passed with the :arg:`max_operands` as 1.

    If :arg:`max_operands` is set to 2, then in every iteration `N` 2Q gates and qubit-pairs which
    exists in the input interaction graph are chosen at random, the qubit-pairs are also chosen at
    random based on the probability attached to the qubit-pair, the 2Q gates are applied on the
    qubit-pairs which are idle for that particular iteration, this is to make sure that for a particular
    iteration only one circuit layer exists, now, if `insert_1q_oper` is set to True, randomly
    chosen 1Q gates are applied to qubits that are still idle for that particular iteration, after
    applying 2Q gates for that particular iteration.
