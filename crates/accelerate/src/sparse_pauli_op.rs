///
/// This is an implementation of the "tensorized Pauli decomposition" presented in
/// `Hantzko, Binkowski and Gupta (2023) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13421>`__.
///
/// Implementation
/// --------------
///
/// The original algorithm was described recurisvely, allocating new matrices for each of the
/// block-wise sums (e.g. `op[top_left] + op[bottom_right]`).  This implementation differs in two
/// major ways:
///
/// - We do not allocate new matrices recursively, but instead produce a single copy of the input
///   and repeatedly overwrite subblocks of it at each point of the decomposition.
/// - The implementation is rewritten as an iteration rather than a recursion.  The current "state"
///   of the iteration is encoded in a single machine word (the `PauliLocation` struct below).
///
/// We do the decomposition in three "stages", with the stage changing whenever we need to change
/// the input/output types.  The first level is mathematically the same as the middle levels, it
/// just gets handled separately because it does the double duty of moving the data out of the
/// Python-space strided array into a Rust-space contiguous array that we can modify in-place.
/// The middle levels all act in-place on this newly created scratch space.  Finally, at the last
/// level, we've completed the decomposition and need to be writing the result into the output
/// data structures rather than into the scratch space.
///
/// Each "level" is handling one qubit in the operator, equivalently to the recursive procedure
/// described in the paper referenced in the docstring.  This implementation is iterative
/// stack-based and in place, rather than recursive.
///
/// We can get away with overwriting our scratch-space matrix at each point, because each
/// element of a given subblock is used exactly twice during each decomposition - once for the `a +
/// b` case, and once for the `a - b` case.  The second operand is the same in both cases.
/// Illustratively, at each step we're decomposing a submatrix blockwise, where we label the blocks
/// like this:
///
///   +---------+---------+          +---------+---------+
///   |         |         |          |         |         |
///   |    I    |    X    |          |  I + Z  |  X + Y  |
///   |         |         |          |         |         |
///   +---------+---------+  =====>  +---------+---------+
///   |         |         |          |         |         |
///   |    Y    |    Z    |          |  X - Y  |  I - Z  |
///   |         |         |          |         |         |
///   +---------+---------+          +---------+---------+
///
/// Each addition or subtraction is done elementwise, so as long as we iterate through the two pairs
/// of coupled blocks in order in lockstep, we can write out the answers together without
/// overwriting anything we need again.  We ignore all factors of 1/2 until the very last step, and
/// apply them all at once.  This minimises the number of floating-point operations we have to do.
///
/// We store the iteration order as a stack of `PauliLocation`s, whose own docstring explains how it
/// tracks the top-left corner and the size of the submatrix it represents.
